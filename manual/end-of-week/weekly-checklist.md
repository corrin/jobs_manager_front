# Weekly Checklist

> **When to use:** End of the week admin procedures -- making sure nothing's fallen through the cracks.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] Access to reports and the Kanban board
- [ ] 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time

## Weekly Tasks

### Review Outstanding Quotes

Check for any quotes that have been sent but not responded to. Open the Kanban board and look at jobs sitting in the "Quoted" column. If anything's been there more than a week, follow up with the customer.

### Check Unbilled Work

Look for jobs that are complete but haven't been invoiced yet. These are jobs sitting in the "Complete" column on the Kanban board, or you can use the Job Aging report under Reports > Management to find them.

Every week a completed job sits uninvoiced is a week you're not getting paid for work you've already done.

### Timesheet Review

Go through each staff member's timesheets for the week using the Daily Overview. Check that:

- Everyone has entered a full day's hours for each day they worked
- The summary shows hours that match their scheduled hours
- There aren't unusual patterns (lots of non-billable time, missing days, etc.)

If someone's hours don't add up, check with them before the week is out. It's much easier to fix on Friday than to reconstruct the following week.

### Month End (Monthly)

At the end of each month, run the month-end process under Admin. This is mostly for shop jobs -- it resets the hours each month so you start fresh.

### Follow-up Actions

- Chase any overdue customer payments (check in Xero)
- Review the [KPI Report](/management/run-reports) for the week -- are we tracking to target?
- Update job statuses on the Kanban board for anything that's moved along during the week
- Flag any jobs that are going over budget so they can be discussed

## Tips

::: tip
Make this a recurring calendar event every Friday afternoon. It takes less time than you think and prevents small problems from becoming big ones.
:::

::: warning
Don't skip the timesheet review. Missing or inaccurate timesheets mean inaccurate job costing, which means you don't know if you're making or losing money.
