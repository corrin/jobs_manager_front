# Complete a Job On-Site

> **When to use:** You're on-site, the work is done, and you need to mark the job as complete.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] Access to Jobs Manager (phone or tablet is fine)
- [ ] Any required sign-off or photos from the customer

## Steps

### 1. Record your time

Make sure all your hours for this job are entered in the timesheets. If you haven't done it during the day, do it now while the details are fresh -- see [End of Day Entry](/timesheets/end-of-day-entry).

### 2. Note any materials used

If you used materials on-site that haven't been recorded yet, make a note. These need to be entered into the Reality section of the job so the costs are accurate.

### 3. Take photos (if needed)

If there's anything worth documenting -- the finished work, any issues found, before/after shots -- attach them to the job. Files added to a job automatically sync to Dropbox as well. See [Attach Files to a Job](/jobs/attach-files).

### 4. Update the job status

Move the job to "Complete" on the Kanban board (or ask office staff to do it if you don't have access). This signals to the office that the work is done and the job is ready for invoicing.

## What Happens Next

- Office staff see the job in the "Complete" column on the Kanban board
- They'll review the timesheets and materials, then [invoice the job](/invoicing/invoice-a-job)
- The job's actual costs feed into the KPI reports automatically

## Tips

::: tip
Take photos of finished work, especially for larger jobs. They're useful for resolving disputes and for showing prospective customers what you've done.
:::

::: warning
Don't mark a job as complete until all your time is entered. Once it moves to invoicing, missing hours mean you either don't get paid for them or someone has to go back and fix it.
