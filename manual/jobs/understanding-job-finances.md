# Understanding Job Finances

> **When to use:** You want to understand how the money works on a job -- what the three financial stages mean and how they fit together.

This isn't a step-by-step task. It's background knowledge that makes everything else make sense.

## The Three-Part Structure

From a commercial perspective, every job is divided into three parts:

- **Time** -- Labour hours and wage/charge rates
- **Materials** -- Physical goods, supplies, stock items
- **Adjustments** -- Everything else: call-out fees, travel, discounts, write-offs

You'll see this three-part breakdown everywhere in the system -- estimates, quotes, reality, and reports.

## The Three Financial Stages

Each job goes through three financial stages. Think of them as three different views of the same job:

### Estimate (What we think it'll cost)

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Estimate tab on a job -->

The estimate is your internal "finger in the air" -- what you think the job will cost us and what we should charge. It has time, materials, and adjustments sections, each with as many lines as you need.

Every job should have an estimate. Even a rough one is better than none.

### Quote (What we tell the customer)

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Quote tab on a job -->

The quote is the customer-facing version. Not every job needs a quote -- T&M (time and materials) jobs where you bill as you go don't need one. But if the customer wants a price upfront, this is where it lives.

The **Copy Estimate to Quote** button gives you a starting point. From there you can adjust -- add contingency, simplify the breakdown, reduce the price to win the work.

Remember: all jobs have an estimate, while only some have a quote.

### Reality (What actually happened)

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Reality/Actual tab with populated data -->

The Reality section shows the real cost and revenue of the job. If revenue is higher than cost, the job made a profit.

- **Time entries** are populated automatically from timesheets. When staff enter time against a job, it shows up here.
- **Materials** need to be entered directly into the Reality section for now.
- **Adjustments** are added manually as needed.

## The Revenue vs Costs Summary

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Revenue and Costs summary tables at the bottom of a job -->

At the bottom of the job you'll see summary tables that put it all together:

**Revenue** shows what the customer is being charged:

| Category               | Estimate | Quote  | Reality |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| Total Time             | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| Total Materials        | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| Total Adjustments      | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| **Total Project Cost** | **$X**   | **$X** | **$X**  |

**Costs** shows what it costs us:

| Category               | Estimate | Quote  | Reality |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| Total Time             | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| Total Materials        | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| Total Adjustments      | $X       | $X     | $X      |
| **Total Project Cost** | **$X**   | **$X** | **$X**  |

The difference between Revenue and Costs is your profit. You can see at a glance whether the job is on track, over budget, or better than expected.

## How It All Connects

1. You [create a job](/enquiries/new-customer-call) and fill in the **Estimate**
2. If the customer needs a price, you populate the **Quote** and [send it](/quoting/send-quote)
3. Staff do the work and enter time -- the **Reality** section fills up automatically
4. When the job is done, you compare Reality to Estimate to see how you went
5. You [invoice the job](/invoicing/invoice-a-job) and it feeds into the [KPI reports](/management/run-reports)

## Tips

::: tip
Get in the habit of checking the Revenue vs Costs summary before invoicing. A quick glance tells you if the job made money or not -- and if not, why not.

::: warning
Don't confuse the Estimate with the Quote. The Estimate is for us (what we think it costs). The Quote is for the customer (what we're charging them). They can be different -- and often should be.
