# Attach Files to a Job

> **When to use:** You need to add drawings, photos, documents, or any other files to a job.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] The file(s) you want to attach (drawings, photos, PDFs, etc.)
- [ ] The job open in Jobs Manager

## Steps

### 1. Open the job and go to the Files section

Navigate to the job and find the Attached Files area.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Files/Attachments section on a job -->

### 2. Upload your files

Drag files into the upload area, or click to browse and select them. You can upload multiple files at once.

### 3. Verify the upload

Your files will appear in the attachments list. They're available immediately to anyone viewing the job.

## Dropbox Sync

Any files you add to a job will immediately turn up in Dropbox as well. This is particularly helpful for the laser cutter -- upload a drawing to the job and it's available on the workshop machine straight away.

The same applies in reverse. Any files you add to the job's Dropbox folder will appear in Jobs Manager. So if it's easier to drop something into Dropbox from your phone or desktop, that works too.

## What Happens Next

- Files are attached to the job and visible to all staff
- Files sync to Dropbox automatically (both directions)
- They stay with the job as a permanent record -- useful for reference on repeat customers or warranty queries

## Tips

::: tip
Always attach drawings to the job rather than emailing them around. That way they're archived and anyone can find them later without hunting through their inbox.

::: tip
Take before/after photos on bigger jobs and attach them. They're invaluable for resolving disputes and for showing prospective customers your work.
