# New Customer Call

> **When to use:** A new or existing customer calls asking about work they need done.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] Customer name and contact details
- [ ] Site address (if different from customer address)
- [ ] Brief description of what they need

## Steps

### 1. Check if they're an existing customer

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of client search -->

Search for the customer by name or phone number. If they exist, you'll see their history.

If they're new, you'll create a record as part of the next step.

### 2. Create a new job

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of create job form -->

Click **Create Job** in the navbar. Fill in the basic details:

- **Job Number** -- This is auto-generated, just like our old paper job numbers.
- **Job Name** -- An internal nickname for the job. This is handy for searching later, so make it something memorable (e.g. "Smith fence repair" rather than "Job for Mr Smith").
- **Client** -- This must match the entry in Xero. Start typing and it'll autocomplete. If the client doesn't exist, you can create one from here.
- **Job Description** -- This gets printed on invoices and quotes, so write it for the customer's eyes. Keep it professional and clear.

### 3. Record the key details

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing a populated job details form -->

The other fields on the job form:

- **Contact Name** and **Phone Number** -- Who to call about this job.
- **Order Number** -- The client's reference number, if they have one.
- **Job Notes** -- Internal notes that only we see. Use this for anything relevant -- site access codes, special instructions, who you spoke to on the phone.

Don't worry about filling in everything right now. The critical fields are the client, job name, and a description. Everything else can be added later as you learn more.

### 4. Set next steps

Once you've saved the job, think about what happens next. Does someone need to go out for a site visit? Can you quote over the phone? Is it a straightforward T&M job that just needs scheduling?

If you know, update the job status on the Kanban board to reflect where it's at. If not, leave it in the first column and it'll get picked up in the normal workflow.

## What Happens Next

- Job appears on the Kanban board where everyone can see it
- Someone picks it up to assess and price -- see [Assess & Price a Job](/quoting/assess-and-price)
- The job number is the reference for everything from here on out

## Tips

::: tip
Always confirm the site address -- it's often different from the customer's postal or billing address. Getting this wrong wastes everyone's time.
:::

::: warning
Don't promise a quote timeframe without checking the schedule first. Better to say "we'll get back to you" than to commit to something you can't deliver.
