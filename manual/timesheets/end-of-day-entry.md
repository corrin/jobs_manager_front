# End of Day Entry

> **When to use:** At the end of the day, you're entering time from staff time cards into the system.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] Time cards from staff (with job numbers, descriptions, and hours)
- [ ] Access to the Timesheets section

## Steps

### 1. Select the staff member and date

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the timesheet header with staff selector, date picker, and hours display -->

Use the staff selector arrows at the top to pick whose time card you're entering. Set the date using the date picker, or hit **Today** to jump to the current date.

The hours display in the header shows you at a glance how many hours have been entered versus the scheduled hours for that day. If the numbers don't match up, something's been missed.

### 2. Choose the job number

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the job number field being selected in the timesheet entry grid -->

Start by entering the job number. This will populate the job name and client automatically -- you don't need to type those in.

### 3. Enter the description and hours

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing a completed timesheet row with description and hours filled in -->

Write the description and the time exactly as the person has written it on their time card. The grid columns are: Job Number, Job Name, Client Name, Description, Hours, Rate, Wage, Bill, Billable, Date, and Approval Status.

### 4. Handle non-billable time

If it's not suitable to bill the client for the time -- say, fixing our own mistake -- untick the **Billable** checkbox. This way staff still get paid without overcharging the client or having to dump time onto shop jobs.

You can add notes if you want, for example explaining why you unticked billable, but normally the description is enough.

### 5. Check the daily summary

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Summary section with Total Hours, Billable Entries percentage, and Non-Billable Entries -->

The summary at the bottom tells you how many hours the staff member has entered for this day. Use it to quickly check whether a full day has been entered. If you see 4.0 out of 8.0, someone's time card is incomplete.

It also shows you the split between billable and non-billable entries so you can spot anything unusual.

### 6. Review from the overview

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the overview bar chart "Comparison of Estimated vs Actual Hours" with blue estimated and orange actual bars per job -->

From the overview you can see all open jobs with the time spent versus the estimate. This is the bar chart view -- blue bars are estimated hours, orange bars are actual hours. If the orange is creeping past the blue, that job is going over budget.

### 7. Check a staff member's jobs

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the "Current Jobs" section with job cards displaying job number, name, client, status, estimated hours, and hours spent -->

From any staff member's view you can see the jobs they've put time on that day. Each job card shows the job number, name, client, status, estimated hours, and hours spent.

You can click on the job number (shown in blue) to jump straight to that job.

## What Happens Next

- Time is recorded against the job and counts toward actual hours
- The hours feed into job costing -- estimated vs actual is tracked automatically
- Billable time will appear when it's time to invoice the client
- Non-billable time is still tracked for payroll but won't be charged to the client

## Tips

::: tip
Enter time at the end of each day while it's fresh. Trying to reconstruct a week's worth of time cards on Friday afternoon never goes well.
:::

::: tip
If you see a staff member consistently under their scheduled hours in the summary, check with them before assuming the time card is wrong -- they may have had a shorter day.
:::

::: warning
Don't just put non-billable time on a shop job to make it disappear. Use the billable checkbox on the actual job instead. That way you still have an accurate picture of how long the real job took -- you just aren't charging the client for it.
