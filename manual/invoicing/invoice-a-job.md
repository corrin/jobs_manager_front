# Invoice a Job

> **When to use:** The work is done, time and materials are recorded, and it's time to bill the customer.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] A completed job with all timesheet entries recorded
- [ ] Materials entered in the Reality section (if applicable)
- [ ] Customer billing details in the system

## Steps

### 1. Check the Reality section

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Reality/Actual tab on a job with populated data -->

Before you invoice, open the job and look at the Reality section. This shows the real cost and revenue of the job -- what actually happened versus what you estimated.

The timesheets section of the app automatically populates the time entries here. If staff have been entering their time correctly, the labour lines should already be filled in. Materials you'll need to enter directly into the Reality section for now.

### 2. Compare estimate to reality

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Revenue and Costs summary tables -->

The system keeps track of the totals for you. Check the Revenue vs Costs summary at the bottom of the job. You'll see columns for Estimate, Quote, and Reality side by side.

Key things to look for:

- **Revenue higher than cost** = the job made a profit
- **Cost higher than revenue** = the job lost money -- investigate before invoicing
- **Big gap between estimate and reality** = something went differently than planned

### 3. Create the invoice

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the invoice creation process -->

Once you're satisfied that the numbers are right, create the invoice. This sends the billing information through to Xero where the actual invoice is generated and sent to the customer.

### 4. Verify in Xero

The invoice should appear in Xero shortly after creation. Check that the amounts match and that the customer details are correct.

## What Happens Next

- The invoice is created in Xero and sent to the customer
- The job status updates to reflect that it's been invoiced
- Payment tracking happens in Xero from this point
- The job's profitability is now final and will show in the KPI reports

## Tips

::: tip
Always check the Reality section before invoicing. If timesheets are missing or materials haven't been recorded, your invoice won't reflect the actual work done -- and you'll either undercharge the customer or have inaccurate job costing.

::: warning
If the Reality section shows the job lost money, don't just invoice and move on. Flag it so the team can learn from it. Was the estimate too low? Did the scope change? Understanding why helps prevent the same thing happening next time.
