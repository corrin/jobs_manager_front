# Schedule a Job

> **When to use:** A quoted job has been accepted and needs to be assigned to staff for work.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] An accepted quote or approved job
- [ ] Knowledge of staff availability
- [ ] Customer's preferred timing (if any)

## Steps

### 1. Find the job on the Kanban board

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Kanban board with jobs in various columns -->

The Kanban board is your scheduling hub. Jobs that are ready to be scheduled will be sitting in the "Approved" column (or similar, depending on your workflow).

### 2. Assign staff

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the staff panel on the Kanban board -->

Use the staff panel at the top of the Kanban board to assign team members to the job. You can see who's already assigned to other jobs to avoid overloading anyone.

### 3. Move the job to the right column

Drag the job card to the appropriate status column (e.g. "In Progress" or "Scheduled") to reflect that it's been assigned and is ready to go.

### 4. Confirm with the customer

Let the customer know when to expect the team on-site. If there are specific access requirements or timing constraints, add them to the job notes so field staff can see them.

## What Happens Next

- Staff can see the job assigned to them on the Kanban board
- The job status is visible to everyone in the office
- Field staff do the work and record progress -- see [Complete a Job On-Site](/fieldwork/complete-a-job)

## Tips

::: tip
Check the job estimate before scheduling. If the estimate shows 2 days of work, make sure you've allowed for that in the schedule rather than squeezing it into a half-day gap.
:::

::: warning
Don't move a job to "In Progress" until it's actually been assigned to someone. An unassigned job in the wrong column just creates confusion.
