# Assess & Price a Job

> **When to use:** You've got a job on the board and you need to work out what to charge before sending a quote.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] A job already created in the system (from the enquiry)
- [ ] A reasonable idea of what the work involves (site visit notes, photos, customer conversation)
- [ ] Access to your rate cards (wage rates, charge-out rates, material costs)

## Steps

### 1. Open the job and go to the Estimate section

Navigate to the job and find the Estimate area. This is where you figure out whether the job is actually worth doing.

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Estimate section on a job page -->

From a commercial perspective, jobs are divided into three parts: **time**, **materials**, and **adjustments**. The estimate mirrors this structure -- you'll see a section for each.

Please don't skip this step. Are we in a financial mess because we've been taking on jobs without knowing if they're profitable, or because we've been taking on jobs despite knowing upfront that we wouldn't make money on them? The estimate is your "finger in the air" -- it doesn't need to be perfect, but it does need to exist.

### 2. Estimate the time

The first grid covers labour. For each line you can enter:

| Column            | What it means                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | What the work is (e.g. "Install signage", "4 folds") |
| **Items**         | How many of this task                                |
| **Mins/Hours**    | Time per item                                        |
| **Total Minutes** | Calculated from Items x Mins/Hours                   |
| **Wage Rate**     | What we pay the staff member per hour                |
| **Charge Rate**   | What we charge the customer per hour                 |

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Time estimate grid with example entries -->

You can have just one line for the whole job, or break it into multiple lines -- e.g. "4 folds" on one line and "final installation" on another. Pragmatically, decide based on how big the job is. Small jobs just get a single total time; bigger jobs benefit from a breakdown so you can see where the hours go.

### 3. Estimate the materials

The second grid covers materials. For each line:

| Column          | What it means                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Item Code**   | Product or material code                          |
| **Description** | What it is                                        |
| **Quantity**    | How many / how much                               |
| **Cost Rate**   | What we pay for it                                |
| **Retail Rate** | What we charge the customer                       |
| **Revenue**     | Calculated from Quantity x Retail Rate            |
| **Comments**    | Anything worth noting (supplier, lead time, etc.) |

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Materials estimate grid with example entries -->

Same principle as time -- one line for "materials" on a small job is fine. On a bigger job, break it out so you can see the margins on each item.

### 4. Add any adjustments

The third grid is for adjustments -- anything that doesn't fit neatly into time or materials. Think call-out fees, travel, discounts, or allowances.

| Column               | What it means                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Description**      | What the adjustment is for              |
| **Cost Adjustment**  | What it costs us                        |
| **Price Adjustment** | What we charge (or credit) the customer |
| **Revenue**          | The net effect on revenue               |
| **Comments**         | Context for anyone reviewing later      |

### 5. Review the totals and check the margin

Before you move on, look at the overall picture. Does the margin make sense? Does the total price feel right for the scope of work? If the numbers say we'll lose money, that's a conversation to have _now_ -- not after we've done the work.

### 6. Copy the estimate to a quote

Once you're happy with the estimate, hit the **Copy Estimate to Quote** button. This takes your workings and creates the customer-facing quote from them.

## What Happens Next

- The estimate is saved on the job as your internal cost/price workings.
- The quote is generated from the estimate, ready to review and send.
- Next step: [Send the Quote](/quoting/send-quote) to the customer.

## Tips

::: tip
The estimate is for _us_ -- it's our internal view of cost vs. price. The quote is what the customer sees. You can be as detailed as you like in the estimate without worrying about what the customer will think.
:::

::: tip
For small jobs, don't overthink it. One line for time, one line for materials, done. Save the detailed breakdowns for jobs where the complexity warrants it.
:::

::: warning
Don't skip the estimate just because the job seems straightforward. A two-minute estimate that shows you'll make 15% margin is infinitely better than no estimate and a nasty surprise at invoicing time.
:::

::: warning
If the estimate shows we'll lose money or barely break even, flag it before sending the quote. It's much easier to adjust pricing now than to explain a loss after the job is done.
