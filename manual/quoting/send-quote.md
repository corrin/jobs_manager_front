# Send a Quote

> **When to use:** The estimate is done, the quote section is filled in, and you need to get it in front of the customer.

## What You'll Need

- [ ] A completed estimate on the job (see [Assess & Price a Job](/quoting/assess-and-price))
- [ ] The quote section populated (use the **Copy Estimate to Quote** button if you haven't already)
- [ ] Customer email address or other contact method

## Steps

### 1. Review the quote

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Quote tab on a job -->

Open the job and go to the Quote section. The quote is what the customer will see, so check that it makes sense from their perspective. The structure is the same as the estimate -- time, materials, and adjustments -- but the numbers might differ.

Remember: all jobs have an estimate, but only some have a quote. If it's a T&M (time and materials) job where you're billing as you go, you can skip the quote entirely and leave this section blank.

### 2. Adjust if needed

The **Copy Estimate to Quote** button gives you a starting point that matches your estimate exactly. From there you might want to:

- Add some contingency (round up)
- Reduce the price to win the job
- Simplify the line items so the customer sees a cleaner breakdown

The estimate stays unchanged as your internal record. The quote is the customer-facing version.

### 3. Send the quote

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing the Quote Job button -->

Use the **Quote Job** button to generate and send the quote to the customer. This creates a formatted quote document that goes out via email.

## What Happens Next

- The customer receives the quote by email
- The job status updates to reflect that a quote has been sent
- When the customer accepts, update the job status and move on to [scheduling](/scheduling/schedule-a-job)
- If they decline or want changes, adjust the quote and resend

## Tips

::: tip
If you used "Copy Estimate to Quote", double-check the numbers before sending. The estimate might have internal notes or line items that don't make sense to the customer.
:::

::: warning
Don't send a quote without an estimate behind it. The estimate is how you know whether the job is profitable. Without it, you're guessing -- and guessing is how you lose money.
