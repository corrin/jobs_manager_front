# Quoting Tool – Minimalist Functional Plan

## Purpose

A structured, estimator-facing quoting tool that:

- Follows a **strict, step-by-step process** with no assumptions  
- Does **not proceed** to calculation until all required information is confirmed  
- Uses current material and labor pricing via MCP  
- Produces a **table of estimated labor and estimated materials**, including:
  - Supplier names  
  - Supplier part numbers  
  - Material cost  
  - Labor effort  
- Shows material usage via **three cross-checked methods**:
  - Area + waste percentage  
  - Tenths-based usage  
  - Proportional (fractional) billing basis  
- Flags missing or inconsistent inputs  
- Outputs a complete, **human-reviewed** quote  

This is a quoting tool, not an AI assistant.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Process Enforcement

Before quoting begins, the tool confirms:

- Job type and fabrication context  
- Quantity  
- Dimensions  
- Material type, thickness, and finish  
- Install vs supply-only  
- Welding, folding, or other fabrication methods  

LLM confirms and reflects this understanding back to the estimator with clear assumptions before calculating anything.

---

### 2. Material & Labor Inputs

- Pricing is fetched via **MCP server queries**  
- MCP tools return structured data from internal or supplier tables  
- Tracks:
  - Sheet metal (type, finish, gauge, size)  
  - Consumables (e.g. hinges, sealants)  
  - Labor categories (fabrication, install, delivery)  
- Remnant stock lookup via internal MCP tool  
- No parsing of attached files—input is freeform text (though files/sketches are allowed)

---

### 3. Calculation Engine

#### 🔁 Two-Phase Quoting Workflow

---

### Phase 1: Material Interpretation & Expansion

LLM role: confirm estimator intent and compute material requirements.  
This phase ends with a complete material plan—no quoting occurs until this is resolved.

The system shows:

#### ✅ Material Usage Estimated Three Ways:

| Method                        | Description                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Area + Waste %**        | Flat area × (1 + waste %) → divide by sheet area                         |
| **2. Tenths (yield logic)**  | Sheet divided into 10 blocks → count tenths used by part layout          |
| **3. Proportional (billing)**| Part area ÷ sheet area = fractional usage per part × quantity            |

- All three values are displayed  
- Divergences help identify edge cases or misinterpretations  
- Tenths are used for **yield planning**, proportional is used for **billing**

---

### Phase 2: Pricing

Once sheet usage is confirmed, the system:

- Queries MCP for **top 2 supplier prices**  
- Flags large pricing gaps (potential spec mismatch)  
- Checks internal remnant availability  
- Applies:
  - Sheet pricing (cheapest and next-cheapest shown)  
  - Labor (based on fabrication type and quantity)  
  - Markup (explicit, editable)  
- Generates full quote breakdown with trace:
  - Flat parts  
  - Tenths consumed  
  - Sheet pricing  
  - Labor assumptions  
  - Final totals

---

### 4. Output

- Structured quote line items (materials, labor, extras)  
- Line-by-line calculation trace  
- Summary table: total, markup, margin  
- Comparison of material usage by all three methods  
- Export to spreadsheet for quoting workflow  
- Estimator-reviewed before client use

---

### 5. Quote Checking Mode

The tool supports a secondary mode: **quote verification**.  
In this mode:

- The user provides both:
  - The original estimator input (text description)  
  - The manually prepared quote table  
- The tool reprocesses the input using the standard calculation engine  
- Compares actual vs expected:
  - Material usage  
  - Supplier selection  
  - Pricing  
  - Labor hours  
- Flags discrepancies or inconsistencies
- Explains the differences in a traceable way

This allows the tool to be used not only for quote generation, but also for training, auditing, and consistency checks.

---

## UI / UX

- **Freeform text interface** (chat-style, single-pass not multi-turn)  
- Estimator enters part descriptions, dimensions, and notes  
- System:
  - Parses and normalizes materials (e.g. “brushed” → “304/4”)  
  - Confirms full assumptions before proceeding  
  - Outputs tabular results with clear trace  
- Supports:
  - Editable overrides  
  - Clarification prompts  
  - Export to quote document  
  - Quote checking mode input form

---

## Non-Goals

- File upload and sketches are allowed, but **not required **.  They're handled as a best effort  
- Estimators are encouraged to provide structured text descriptions  
- No quote outcome prediction (win/loss modelling).  This is a tool for turning a job request into a dollar number.
- No pricing strategy automation  
- No quoting without estimator confirmation and review

---

## Next Step

Model one real job (e.g. splashback or welded box) end-to-end using this structure.  
Include:
- Estimator input  
- System clarification  
- Full material plan by 3 methods  
- Price comparison  
- Quote output with trace  
- Quote checking validation (optional)
