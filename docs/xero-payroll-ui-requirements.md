# Xero Payroll UI Requirements

**For:** Frontend Vue.js Implementation
**Backend Branch:** `feature/xero-payroll` (backend complete, REST API not yet implemented)
**Date:** 2025-11-04

## Overview

Office manager needs UI to:

1. Create Draft pay runs for weekly periods
2. Post staff timesheets to existing pay runs
3. View posting results and handle errors

## User Workflow

**Weekly Process:**

1. **Monday-Friday:** Office manager enters daily timesheets as normal (no change to existing timesheet entry UI)
2. **End of Week (or before):**
   - Office manager navigates to "Weekly Timesheets" page
   - Creates pay run for the week (if not already created)
   - Posts hours to Xero for each staff member
   - Reviews results
3. **In Xero:** Office manager reviews pay run, approves, posts (locks it)
4. **Next Week:** Cannot modify previous week once Posted in Xero

## Page: Weekly Timesheets

### Location

Existing page: Weekly timesheets view (where office manager reviews entered hours)

### New UI Elements Required

#### 1. Pay Run Management Section (Top of Page)

**Display Current Week Info:**

```
Week: Nov 10-16, 2025 (Mon-Sun)
Payment Date: Nov 19, 2025 (Wed)
Pay Run Status: [Draft | Posted | Not Created]
```

**Button: "Create Pay Run for This Week"**

- Visible when: Pay run doesn't exist for current week
- Hidden when: Pay run already exists
- Action: Calls `POST /api/payroll/create-pay-run/`
  - Request: `{ "week_start_date": "2025-11-10" }` (Monday)
  - Response: `{ "pay_run_id": "uuid", "status": "Draft", "payment_date": "2025-11-19" }`
- On success: Show success message, hide button, show "Pay run created" status
- On error:
  - If "only be one draft pay run": Tell user "A draft pay run already exists for a different week. Please post or delete it in Xero first."
  - Other errors: Display error message from backend

**Pay Run Status Indicator:**

- **Draft** (green): "✓ Pay run ready for posting"
- **Posted** (blue/locked): "🔒 Pay run locked (already paid)"
- **Not Created** (gray): "Pay run not created yet"

#### 2. Staff Timesheet Posting Section

**For each staff member with hours this week:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

#### 3. Bulk Actions (Optional Enhancement)

**Button: "Post All Staff to Xero"**

- Posts all staff with hours for this week sequentially
- Shows progress: "Posting 3 of 10 staff..."
- Reports summary at end

    },
    // ... more staff
  ]
}
```

## Backend Service Layer

**Already implemented:** `apps/timesheet/services/payroll_sync.py`

The REST API endpoints will call:

- `PayrollSyncService.post_week_to_xero(staff_id, week_start_date)` → Returns dict with results
- `create_pay_run(week_start_date)` from `apps/workflow/api/xero/payroll.py` → Returns pay_run_id

## Error Handling

### User-Friendly Error Messages

**Backend Error → Frontend Display:**

| Backend Error                                        | User Message                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "week_start_date must be a Monday"                   | "Invalid date selected. Please select a Monday."                                                                                         |
| "No pay run found for week..."                       | "Please create a pay run for this week first using the 'Create Pay Run' button above."                                                   |
| "Pay run...is already Posted and cannot be modified" | "This week's payroll has already been finalized and paid. You cannot modify locked pay runs. Contact payroll if corrections are needed." |
| "Staff member...does not have a xero_user_id"        | "This staff member is not linked to Xero. Please contact your administrator to configure Xero integration for this user."                |
| "There can only be one draft pay run"                | "Another draft pay run exists for a different week. Please complete or delete it in Xero before creating a new one."                     |
| Connection/auth errors                               | "Unable to connect to Xero. Please try again or contact support if the problem persists."                                                |

## Permissions

- **Office Manager / Payroll Admin:** Can post any staff member's hours
- **Staff Member:** Can only post their own hours (if we allow self-posting, TBD)
- **Viewer:** Cannot post (read-only access to timesheets)

## Visual Design Notes

- Use existing Jobs Manager color scheme and component library
- Pay run status should be prominent and clear
- Posting progress/results should be non-intrusive but visible
- Error messages should be helpful and actionable
- Loading states should prevent double-posting

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Week Selection:** The page should have a week picker. Default to current week, allow browsing past weeks.

2. **Locked Weeks:** Once a pay run is Posted in Xero, clearly indicate it's locked. Gray out post buttons, show lock icon.

3. **Re-posting:** If staff hours are edited after initial posting (but before pay run is Posted), allow re-posting. Backend will delete old lines and replace with new data.

4. **Zero Hours:** If staff has zero hours for the week, don't show them in the list (or show grayed out with "No hours entered").

5. **Validation:** Client-side validation for Monday dates before API calls.

6. **Confirmation:** Consider confirmation dialog for "Post to Xero" to prevent accidental posts.

## Testing Checklist for Frontend

- [ ] Create pay run button appears when no pay run exists
- [ ] Create pay run button hidden when pay run already exists
- [ ] Post buttons disabled when no pay run exists
- [ ] Post buttons disabled when pay run is Posted (locked)
- [ ] Loading states work correctly during posting
- [ ] Success message displays with correct breakdown
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Re-posting works after editing hours
- [ ] Page refreshes pay run status correctly
- [ ] Week picker changes week and updates all data
- [ ] Bulk post (if implemented) handles errors gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Backend Claude: Implement REST API endpoints (this document describes them)
2. Frontend Claude: Implement UI based on this spec
3. Test end-to-end with demo data
4. Deploy to staging for office manager testing
