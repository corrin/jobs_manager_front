# Executive Summary: Numeric Fields Audit and Migration

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Important note: This plan excludes unit and integration test suites. Validation will be performed through static analysis (TypeScript/ESLint/pattern auditing) and manual validation guided by checklists, with UAT in staging for critical flows.

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current Situation

The Jobs Manager Frontend has 96 numeric fields that were previously treated as strings but should now be handled as native numeric types. The audit identified 388 unnecessary conversion points in the code that need to be eliminated.

### Problem Impact

- Degraded performance due to constant conversions
- More complex code with redundant parsing/serialization
- Risk of bugs in critical financial calculations
- Reduced maintainability

### Solution Strategy (without automated tests)

Systematic migration in 5 phases, eliminating unnecessary conversions and treating all affected fields as native numbers, with:

- TypeScript (tsc) validation in strict mode
- ESLint rules to prevent regressions
- Automated pattern auditing (scripts)
- Manual validation checklists per component/screen
- UAT in staging for Timesheet and Costing
- Manual performance sampling on heavy screens

## 📊 AUDIT DATA

### Fields Identified by Category

- Financial: 23 fields — HIGH Priority — Critical calculations
- Quantities: 15 fields — HIGH Priority — Inventory/Production
- Time: 4 fields — MEDIUM Priority — Hours control
- Percentages: 4 fields — MEDIUM Priority — Metrics/Markups
- Metrics: 3 fields — LOW Priority — Reports

### Conversions Found in Code

- parseFloat(): 156 occurrences
- parseInt(): 89 occurrences
- Number(): 78 occurrences
- toString(): 65 occurrences
- TOTAL: 388 in 67 unique files

### Most Critical Files

1. TimesheetEntryView.vue — 25 conversions
2. JobEstimateTab.vue — 18 conversions
3. StaffFormModal.vue — 15 conversions
4. JobActualTab.vue — 12 conversions
5. useTimesheetEntryCalculations.ts — 11 conversions

---

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phased Approach

- ✅ Phase 1: Timesheet System — CRITICAL Priority — High Risk — 5 main files — **COMPLETED**
- 🔄 Phase 2: Job Costing — HIGH Priority — Medium Risk — 6 components — **IN PROGRESS**
- ⏳ Phase 3: Purchasing — MEDIUM Priority — Medium Risk — 4 components — **PENDING**
- ⏳ Phase 4: Forms & Modals — MEDIUM Priority — Low Risk — 8 forms — **PENDING**
- ⏳ Phase 5: Reports & Utils — LOW Priority — Low Risk — report components — **PENDING**

### Validation (without unit/integration tests)

- Static analysis: tsc (strict) + ESLint (conversion rules)
- Automated auditing: script to locate parseFloat/parseInt/Number/toString
- Manual checklists per file (create/edit/calculate/sync)
- UAT in staging for flows:
  - Timesheet entry (lines, wage/bill totals)
  - Job costs (cost lines, totals and cards)
  - Purchase receiving (quantities and totals)
- Manual performance sampling (DevTools) on grids and heavy lists

## 🛠️ TOOLS AND CONTROLS

### Automation Scripts

- audit-numeric-conversions: identifies conversion patterns
- validate-numeric-types: validates types/expected usage in files
- auto-migrate-fields: removes simple conversion patterns

### Rules and Checks

- ESLint: rules to prevent numeric conversion regressions
- TypeScript: strict mode with zero errors
- CI: checks to prevent merges with unnecessary conversions

### Manual Validation Checklists

- Per file: removals applied, scenarios tested, calculations verified
- Per phase: all files migrated, audits clear, phase UAT completed

## ⚠️ RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

| Risk                           | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Financial calculation breakage | Medium      | High   | Focused manual checklists + result parity + phase rollback    |
| API incompatibility            | Low         | Medium | Backend coordination + schema validation + service type-check |
| UI formatting issues           | Low         | Low    | Isolated formatting utilities + visual checks                 |

Contingency Plan

- Quick rollback per phase (git revert + deploy)
- Error monitoring and visual total verification in staging
- Point-by-point scenario comparison before/after

## 📈 EXPECTED BENEFITS

Technical

- 10–15% improvement in intensive calculations (estimate)
- ~95% reduction in unnecessary conversions
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Lower risk of numeric bugs

Operational

- Zero downtime in phased rollout
- Maintained API compatibility
- Preserved or improved UX

Financial

- Fewer bugs in critical calculations
- Reduced future maintenance effort
- Facilitates audits and traceability
