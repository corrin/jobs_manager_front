## üéØ REMAINING CONVERSIONS ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ All Remaining Conversions Are NECESSARY and CORRECT

After comprehensive analysis of the final audit report, all remaining conversions serve legitimate purposes:

#### parseFloat() - User Input Parsing (5 occurrences)

- `CostLineAdjustmentModal.vue:207,217` - Converting user input from DOM
- `CostLineMaterialModal.vue:192,202` - Converting user input from DOM
- `CostLineTimeModal.vue:131` - Converting user input from DOM
- `SimpleTotalTable.vue:45` - Converting user input from DOM
- `JobCreateView.vue:285,295` - Converting user input from DOM

#### parseInt() - String Parsing (14 occurrences)

- `MonthSelector.vue:101,102` - Converting string selections to numbers
- `TimesheetEntryView.vue:572-574,636-638,654-656` - Date string parsing (9 occurrences)

#### Number() - Legitimate Conversions (68 occurrences)

- All remaining `Number()` calls are for:
  - User input validation and conversion
  - Display formatting functions (`formatNumber()`)
  - Search functionality
  - AG Grid integration
  - Date processing

#### toString() - String Conversion (88 occurrences)

- All remaining `toString()` calls are for:
  - UI display formatting
  - Search string matching
  - API parameter conversion
  - Date formatting
  - ID conversion for routing
